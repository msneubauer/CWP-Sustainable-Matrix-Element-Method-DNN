There are several activities which are proposed to further develop the idea of a Sustainable Matrix Element Method. The first is to establish a cross-experiment group interested in developing the ideas presented in this Section, along with a common software project for ME calculations, for example in the spirit of~\cite{MoMEMta}. Given the nature of the challenges for a sustainable ME method, this is area which is very well-suited for impactful collaboration with computer scientists and those working in machine learning, so effort should be placed in establishing those connections. Using a few test cases (e.g. $t\bar{t}$ or $t\bar{t}h$ production), evaluation of DDN choices and configurations, developing methods for DNN training from full ME calculations and direct comparisons of the integration accuracy between Monte Carlo and DNN-based calculations should be undertaken. More effort should also be placed in developing compelling applications of the ME method for HL-LHC physics. In the longer term and after successfully demonstrating the value of the methods on a few test cases, we propose exploring the possibilty of Sustainable-Matrix-Element-Method-as-a-Service (SMEMaaS) where shared software and infrastructure could be used through a common API.
