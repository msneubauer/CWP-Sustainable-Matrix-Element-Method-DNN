As a multivariate analysis approach, the ME method brings in several
unique and desirable features, most notably it (1) does not require
training data being an \emph{ab initio} calculation of event
probabilities, (2) incorporates all available kinematic information of
a hypothesized process, including all correlations, and (3) has a
clear physical meaning in terms transition probabilities within the
framework of quantum field theory.
